Samples can often be a good estimate of the population.

The error is the sample mean - the population mean. It shows how off your sample was from the population. Can indicate whether or not it was a good representation of the population.

Confidence interval is x - z(alpha)*standard err
	get the z by subtracting from 1 and looking that table in the middle 

We are 95% confident that the population mean is in the range(x, x1)

Parameter - Population
Statistic - Sample

x < 30 for t
Students t is for smaller samples where population stats may be unknown
	formula for t-1(DoF) = x - mu / standard error
	formula for interval is same as z but with t

The z score formula can be used to scale a test

The Probability of an individual number in a continuous distribution is 0!

Confidence Interval to estimate the parameter of interest. Pretty much always talking about population mean. 

IN PYTHON:
Stats.norm.interval(alpha, loc(mean), scale(sd) for Z
stats.t.interval(alpha, df, loc, scale) for t

CLT - The mean of our sample means is equal to our population mean

In a skewed diet, the sample size should be above 30

**Most of the time you use t distribution b/c you donâ€™t know the pop mean
As the sample size gets larger in the t it approximates the normal distribution
Once you get above 100, you can use the z distribution off hand


Population proportion CI 
p+=za/2ssqrt(p*1-p/n)
