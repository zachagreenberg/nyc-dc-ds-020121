CHI SQUARED

Association between categorical variables

Goodness of Fit - Does observed frequency differ from theoretical
Ie how people identify politically, does it fit a theoretical distribution seeing if they are the same
Does the actual one differ from the theoretical

Homogeneity - are two population distributions are the same
Ie distribution of students in different majors

Independence - if variables are independent of eachother
Ie political identification and how you vote on an issue(ie voting rights of prisoners) 
	NULL: They are independent
	ALT: They are not
		ie z for when you have more than two groups that your comparing against (ie survival rate and different kinds of cancer)

Data should be frequencies
Categories are mutually exclusive 
Observations are independent of each other
