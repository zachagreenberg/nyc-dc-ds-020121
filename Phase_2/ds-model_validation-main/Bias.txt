Bias Variance Notes

Too simple - bias underfit
Complex - high variance overfit


You can’t have a high variance that is underfit

Model with high variance will change a lot if you take a different set of data

If model is simple it won’t change that much if you drop one house 

Variance the parameters will vary a lot if you were to take a different set of training data
