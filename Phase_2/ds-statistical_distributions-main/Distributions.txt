Distributions

PYTHON: 
Put the counts of set into a DataFrame PMF is counts / length of set
Discrete - PMF
	It is a map of the outcomes of the trial by probability
Continuous - PDF

Bernoulli - success or no ie(coin toss (looks like a 7/10 split))
Poisson - events in a time period where rate of occurrence in constant ie(visitors to a website)
Uniform - all events are equally likely
Gaussian - Bell shape

E(x) is expected value. It is essentially the mean, but that is because as more and more trials are completed, the expected value will get closer to the mean.

For Bernoulli with < or > you have to add the prob of all up to it
    If anything, the combinations formula is very good for this. 
        The formula = n!/(x!(n-x!)) * (p**x) * (1-p)**(n-x)
