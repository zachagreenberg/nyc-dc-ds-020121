Bayes 
p_A_given_B = (p_B_given_A * p_A) / (p_B_given_A * p_A + p_B_given_notA * p_notA)

P_A is prior -- prob of hypothesis
P_B is marginal likelihood -- prob of observing the evidence (normalization)
P_B_given_A is likelihood -- prob of observing new evidence given hypothesis
P_A_given_B is posterior -- what were trying to estimate
