Probability Notes

Permutation - Order matters (arrange) 
Combination 

E - means belong to
E w/ slash - means does not belong to 
Union - combining the sets and getting the unique values
A  C AUB
C-means subset
Intersection (N) - takes the common elements ONLY
ANB C A & ANB C B
Difference of A-B is the elements of A NOT in B
IF INTERSECTION OF SETS IS EMPTY THEY ARE DISJOINT

PYTHON:
.issubset(), .union(), .intersection(), .difference()

Universal set(S) defines all possible outcomes {sample space}
Event space is the collection of events we ‘care’ about
Prob is Event/Universal

Permutations - Order matters
Combinations - Order does not matter *LOOK UP FORMULAS* math.factorial

Axioms of Prob
	Non negative 
	 ANB = 0, AUB = A+B IF DISJOINT, ELSE AUB = A+B-ANB
	Prob of sample space is 1
	 
If events do NOT have an effect on each other they are INDEPENDENT (ie replacing before next trial)

If events cannot happen at the same time, they are DISJOINT (Mutually Exclusive)  
 ANB = 0, AUB = A+B
IF NOT DISJOINT (aka NOT EXCLUSIVE)  AUB = A+B-ANB

Dependent events, the first event has an effect on the second event occurring(ie no replacement)

PYTHON:
np.random.choice()

Conditional Probability dividing by the known fact that something has to occur
A/B = ANB
	B
	Product Rule puts the ANB on the other side of the equation
	Product Rule - for independent events it is ANB

	Chain Rule

Bayes Theorem helps you to switch conditional probabilities, and gives you the ability to come at conditional given different knowledge

A/B = B/A A
	B

Law of Total Probability is used with partitions so that if the events are Disjoint, the probability of A inside the sections of B is (ANB1) + (ANB2) + (ANB3) and we’ll often use conditional prob to find it
