HYPOTHESIS TESTING NOTES

Important parts of the scientific method
Alternative and null hypothesis
	The null hypothesis simply means that your other hypothesis is not true

When you carry out your statistical tests you will check to see if the results are significant

You got either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis

A good experiment should have a control group

Single blind study is when the participants don't know what group they're in, double blind is when neither the participants or the administrators know

We will always assume every sample is independent, every sample is collected randomly, the sample is normally distributed, and the sample size is appropriate.  Larger sample sizes are better for randomness

A good experiment should be reproducible

The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between A and B

The alternative hypothesis is traditionally the one that is thought of when conducting the experiment

If the P value is .03 you can think of this is saying that there is a 3% chance of obtaining the results I'm seeing when the Null is true

Alpha is the marginal threshold at which you are OK with rejecting the null can be between 0 and 1
	most common is .05

If the P value is less than alpha then you reject the null hypothesis and you except that there is no relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It doesn't prove anything it just shows that there's no evidence to support the alternative

If it is less you reject the null and except the alternative and if it is greater and you fail to reject the null.

I one tail test is when you want to know if a parameter is greater than or less than a different parameter (one directional

A two tall test is basically saying that one is not equal to the other so it can vary in either direction

Again the results do not prove that there is a relationship in other shows that there is evidence to support or not evidence to support that there may be a relationship

The one sample Z test is used only for tests related to the sample mean
It is best suited for situations where you wanna investigate whether a given sample comes from a particular population

With a one sample Z test, when you do the equation to get the Z score if you subtract it from one that gives you your P value

Type I is False Positive
Type II is False Negative

T Test, Z Test, Effect Size

For Z Test ABS blue of Z score needs to be > z critical value
If the ABS Value of t score is lower that the t statistic, we CANNOT reject the null

P value for one sided is 1 - the number
Two sided is 1 - Pval * 2

Identify Null and Alternative
Select Alpha
Identify sampling distribution
Calculate Test Stat
Calculate pval OR find rejection region(critical value)
Declaring Conclusion

Rejection region is rang of values where null is NOT possible. Critical value separates rejection region from non-rejection 

alpha is prob of type 1 error

When a t test is so large, you can use the z critical values to compare the test statistic
