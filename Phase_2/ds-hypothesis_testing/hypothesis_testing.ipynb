    "* A statistical hypothesis test is a method for testing a hypothesis about a parameter in a population using data measured in a sample. \n",
    "* Hypothesis tests consist of a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "* We test a hypothesis by determining the chance of obtaining a sample statistic if the null hypothesis regarding the population parameter is true. \n",
    "* One-sample $z$-tests and one-sample $t$-tests are hypothesis tests for the population mean $\\mu$. \n",
    "* We use a one-sample $z$-test for the population mean when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is sufficiently large. We use a one-sample $t$-test for the population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown or when the sample size is small. \n",
