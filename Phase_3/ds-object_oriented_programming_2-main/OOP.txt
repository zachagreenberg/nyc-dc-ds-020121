Notes on OOP

copy will create a copy so you can maintain the original, except when it gets too complicated like a nested list then deepcopy will create a copy so you can maintain the original

attribute is no parenthesis
method is parenthesis

instantiate an obj:
num = Calculator()

with the __init__ is has all the attributes and methods when called automatically
