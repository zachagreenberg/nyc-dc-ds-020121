Calculus

Rate of change is how something changes
	Ie steepness of a hill

Slope is change in y over change in x
	y2-y1 delta y rise
	x2-x1 delta x run

Derivative instantaneous rate of change

f(x-deltax) - fx / delta x
Y2 - y1

We want to know what the number is if we were to keep making the delta x smaller and smaller to 0

Power rule
X2 = 2x

Constants apply them at the last second 

Additive Rule
x + y  = der x + der y

Product Rule
Fx gx = fx*g’x + gx*f’x

x2*x = x3
x2*1 + 2x*x = 3x2

When derivative goes from pos to negative it has to go to 0 at some point 

First derivative does the extreme points the 0 ones. Candidates for max and min
Second derivative identifies the what the min or max is or conduction pt. Plug the x from the derivative into the second

If we know we’re going up and getting less steep we know we are getting close to the max or vice versa. This is called the LOCAL MAX

Partial Derivatives
Looks like a curly d

D/dx is partial derive for respective x

Treat the other variables as a constant
X2 y 
2xy respect to x

X2 y
x2 respect to y

Gradient descent puts the change in a vector
