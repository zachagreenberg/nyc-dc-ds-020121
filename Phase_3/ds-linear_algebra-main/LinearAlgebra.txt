system of equations:
np.linalg.inv(preds.T.dot(preds)).dot(preds.T).dot(target)

inverse:
np.linalg.inv(matrix)

AI = IA = A

identity = np.eye(dimension)

column vector 
np.array([[4],[5]])

row:
np.array([[4,5]])

NOTE THE DIFFERENCE

Multiplication use the @ or .dot()

Vector is an ordered list of numbers (list) First number is x axis — x, y, z

Vector addition is matching the coordinates together
Scaling is multiplying the components of a scalar

Arrow in a coordinate system

Basis vectors are I-hat and j-hat

Scaling two vectors is called a linear combination

The span is the set of all the linear combinations

Linearly independent if they add different dimensions 

Linear transformation is a function — transformation suggests movement

Linear must be in a line and origin is in place 

Matrix transformation, column 1 is ihat column2 is that   

90 counter clockwise degree is [[01][-10]]

Shear [[10][11]]
