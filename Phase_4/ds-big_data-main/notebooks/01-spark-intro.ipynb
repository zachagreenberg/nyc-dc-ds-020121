    "Spark is a tool for the management of big data. Sometimes data science professionals will refer to the [five \"V\"s](https://blog.unbelievable-machine.com/en/what-is-big-data-definition-five-vs) of big data. Clearly, the availabilty and size of datasets are growing rapidly. What counts as \"big data\"? Roughly speaking, we're talking about datasets that are too large to be processed on a single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many large companies are relying on big data these days, and Spark is a major player in the big data game. Examples can be found [here](https://www.icas.com/thought-leadership/technology/10-companies-using-big-data) and [here](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/apache-spark) and [here](https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-companies-that-use-apache-spark).\n",
    "\n",
    "So ... how in the world *do* you process a dataset that's too large for a single machine? You use multiple machines linked together! Let's call each machine a *node*, and the group of all machines working in parallel a *cluster*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin story of Spark starts with [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce), whose programs comprise (unsurprisingly) a \"map\" routine (for filtering and sorting) and a \"reduce\" routine (for performing some aggregate operation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce#Logical_view):\n",
    "\n",
    "An early major player in big data that used MapReduce was [Hadoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop). Hadoop was (and still is) a framework for distributed data processing. Its processing component used MapReduce, but it also had a storage component called the \"Hadoop Distributed File System\".\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia: \"Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. It then transfers packaged code into nodes to process the data in parallel. This approach takes advantage of data locality, where nodes manipulate the data they have access to. This allows the dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are distributed via high-speed networking\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But Spark appeared as open source in 2010, and had some advantages over Hadoop MapReduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark's advances over Hadoop MapReduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "- data processing in memory rather than on disks\n",
    "- a single framework for machine learning, graph analysis, and processing of streaming data (pp. 159-160)\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on the advantages of Spark over MapReduce, see [this piece](https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume113/number1/pxc3900531.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed computing can help enormously with speed. Check out [this website](http://sortbenchmark.org) for the latest in speed records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"As a framework, it combines a core engine for distributed computing with an advanced programming model for in-memory processing. Although it has the same linear scalability and fault tolerance capabilities as those of MapReduce, it comes with a multistage in-memory programming model comparing to the rigid map-then-reduce disk-based model\" (146).\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustration, p. 148, of Spark guts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Running a Spark application involves five key entities ... a driver program, a cluster manager, workers, executors and tasks. A driver program is an application that uses Spark as a library and defines a high-level control flow of the target computation. While a worker provides CPU, memory and storage resources to a Spark application, an executer \\[sic\\] is a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) process that Spark creates on each worker for that application. A job is a set of computations (e.g., a data processing algorithm) that Spark performs on a cluster to get results to the driver program. A Spark application can launch multiple jobs. Spark splits a job into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of stages where each stage is a collection of tasks. A task is the smallest unit of work that Spark sends to an executor. The main entry point for Spark functionalities is a SparkContext through which the driver program access \\[sic\\] Spark. A SparkContext represents a connection to a computing cluster\" (149).\n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs, Transformations, and Actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tolerance achieved by keeping a record of the RDD's lineage. There are *redundancies* in the data records, so that, in the event of node failure, the other nodes can provide for data recovery. This is what makes these RDDs *resilient*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transformations take one from an RDD to another RDD;\n",
    "- Actions take one from an RDD to an output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcast variables and accumulators act as global variables; the latter are for counters or sums.\n",
