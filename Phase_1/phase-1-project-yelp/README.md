# Phase 1 Project

You've made it all the way through the first phase of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-Phase project! This project should take 20 to 30 hours to complete.

## Project Overview

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

You and your partner are looking to open a small business and trying to decide the best type of business to open and where is the should be located. You want to base your decision on hard data and decide to use Yelp's API to get data for your analysis. The data for your analysis will come primarily from Yelp's API. The type of businesses and potential markets for your business are to open to your choosing. In your analysis, you can either compare two different types of businesses in the same market (coffee shop vs. gym in Detroit), or one type of business in two different markets (spa in Miami vs LA).  The geographical areas that you are comparing can be two cities/towns or, for large cities, it can be two separate parts of that city (Queens vs. BK). You and your partner will decide the criteria for selecting the area to open your business, but it must be based in your data analysis.

### The Data

While your data will primarily come from Yelp, you can augment it with any other data source you feel will help improve your analysis. For example, you can use census data do help determine which market has your target audience. Below is a blog from a former Flatiron student about how to access census data through python. This is just one example of a data source, but you are open to any others you find on your own.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
  - You will create a new repository (outside of your lecture repo) that will contain your data files, if less than 100mb, all of the notebooks/code you use to perform your analysis, a read.me, a notebook detailing your analysis and conclusions, and any other supporting files.  
* A **Project Jupyter Notebook**
  - This notebook will present a concise and cleaned-up version of your analysis. The aim of it should be that a potential employer can see your ability to write code and your thought process of your analysis.
* A **non-technical presentation**
  - Using PowerPoint or Google Slideshow, you will create and deliver a presentation to your classmates detailing your analysis and conclusions.

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic for instructions on creating and submitting your deliverables. Refer to the rubric associated with this assignment for specifications describing high-quality deliverables.

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Microsoft) should take.

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of Microsoft's new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing this assignment, the rubric at the bottom of it, and the "Project Submission & Review" page. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor ASAP.

Next, we recommend you check out [Project Templates and Examples repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template) and use the MVP template for your project.


## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
