https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template

BUSINESS PROBLEM:
Looking to open a small business and trying to decided what to open and where
Generating insights for a stakeholder

DATA:
Using Yelp API for getting data OR OTHERS 
Can use other data: ie csv, census data(there is a Python package for this)

Using census data: https://towardsdatascience.com/accessing-census-data-with-python-3e2f2b56e20d
pip install census OR conda install census

** YOU NEED TO PICK YOUR LOCATIONS FIRST **

Compare 2 businesses in the same market
OR
1 business and two markets(locations)
(Easier to do two different locations that are farther away)

ie	which business has most locations per capita
	which has a lot of 5 star reviews
	you can look at price distribution

EDA is going to be poking around and looking at details
NEEDS TO BE DATA THAT SUPPORTS DECISION


NEED TO TURN IN:

GitHub Repo - New repository OUTSIDE OF Repo
	containing Data files(theyâ€™ll be csv, NOT larger than 100MB)
	all notebooks done with Data Analysis
	include a README.md

Jupyter Notebook what shows a CLEANED version of your analysis

Non-technical presentation
	Using PPT or Google Slides to focus on Business Problem and Analysis
