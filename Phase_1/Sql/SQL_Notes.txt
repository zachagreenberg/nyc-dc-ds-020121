SQL Notes

-START WITH :import sqlite3
            conn = sqlit3.connect(data)
            cur = conn.cursor()
-cur.execute(“”” SELECT statement;”””).fetchall() 

-put your fetchall into a Dataframe
    df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())
    df.columns = [x[0] for x in cur.description]

Some commands:

ORDER BY ASC is default
LIMIT limits the amount you see
BETWEEN this AND that
IS NULL looks for null
COUNT counts the records that match your condition
GROUP BY groups by a certain condition — has AGG functions like in Pandas
HAVING clause is like WHERE but after group
JOIN brings multiple tables together
USING is the defining column that joins them 
AS is creating an alias, but also you can do something like this : product p or p.product
Subqueries are like list comprehensions
