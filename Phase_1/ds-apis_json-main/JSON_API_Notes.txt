More Notes on JSON and API:

How to open a JSON:
import json
With open(‘data.json’) as f:
data = json.load(f)


JSONS are typically in nested dictionary types of some sort
You can put the converted file into PANDAS ie pd.DataFrame(data[‘response’][‘docs])
Use lambda functions to help break apart data and create new columns!


Look into the API part of the documentation for how to access APIs using request and how to create secret folders to store your API key
